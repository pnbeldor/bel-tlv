# bel-tlv
The implementation and use of TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding in C++. TLV is a simple binary encoding format commonly used in protocols and file formats.

Key Features

    Type Safety: Strongly typed TLV structures

    Flexibility: Support for various data types

    Nested Structures: Ability to create complex nested TLV structures

    Error Handling: Proper exception handling for malformed data

    Memory Management: Smart pointers for automatic memory management

    Extensibility: Easy to add new TLV types

Common Use Cases

    Network protocols

    Configuration files

    Binary data serialization

    Embedded systems communication

    Database record formats

This implementation provides a solid foundation for working with TLV encoding in C++ and can be extended based on your specific requirements.
